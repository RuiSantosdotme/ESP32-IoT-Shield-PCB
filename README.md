# ESP32 IoT Shield PCB with Dashboard for Outputs and Sensors

In this project we'll show you how to build an IoT shield PCB for the ESP32 and a web server dashboard to control it. The shield is equipped with a BME280 sensor (temperature, humidity and pressure), an LDR (light dependent resistor), a PIR motion sensor, a status LED, a pushbutton and a terminal socket to connect a relay module or any other output.
